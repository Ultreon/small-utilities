Why is it only for viewing purposes? Because I don't like that people copy my work.
I only have the code public because people can built the code themselves, if they want to.
You can still use the jar files, as long as you don't redistribute it.
Making a mod pack is fine as long it's a CurseForge modpack (and you don't include it in the zip file itself, but as reference for the launcher to download).
